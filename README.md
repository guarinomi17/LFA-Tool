A tool to help decrypyt substitution ciphers.

* Takes an input ciphertext and finds the frequency of each letter
* Shows the average frequency of the letters in the English language
* Uses a word solver to list possible plaintext words for a given partially decrypted ciphertext word
* Colors plaintext/ciphertext for easier visualization

Written in python 3.7 with no external libraries
